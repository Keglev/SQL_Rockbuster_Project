ROCKBUSTER STEALTH PROJECT


Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company that used to have stores around the
world. Facing stiff competition from streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime,
the Rockbuster Stealth management team is planning to use its existing movie licenses to
launch an online video rental service in order to stay competitive.
This project is a Business Inteligence project, and the objective is to give insights from the data, from inventory to customer insights, with data-related
queries. 


DATA

The task is to load all of Rockbuster’s data into a relational database
management system (RDBMS). Then, I used SQL to analyze the data and answer any
ad-hoc business questions.
The data set that contains information about Rockbuster’s
film inventory, customers, and payments, among other things. The first thing you’ll need to
do is load the data set into the PostgreSQL database. Keep in mind the following points
regarding the data set:
* It is the file name "Rockbuster.tar"
● It’s around 3MB and contains several files.
● A relationship exists between two tables if a column name is present in both tables.


TOOLS


To run this queries, first open the dataset in POSTGRES PGDMIN4. After that you can simply copy and paste the queries in PGADMIN.
